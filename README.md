# Next.js 15 Client-Side API Route Fetch Error in Production

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered when fetching data from an API route in a Next.js 15 application deployed to a production environment. The issue only surfaces in production and not during local development.

## Problem Description

The `pages/about.js` component attempts to fetch data from `/api/data` using `fetch`. This works flawlessly in development, but in production, it throws an error because the API route is not properly handled on the client-side in production.  The error often manifests as a blank page or a generic error message.

## Solution

The provided solution in `aboutSolution.js` involves using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` async functions to handle the API call at build time or request time, respectively. This allows for proper data fetching without encountering client-side rendering issues in production.
